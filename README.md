## Hello 

I'm a research software engineer at the UK's National Oceanography Centre (NOC: https://www.noc.ac.uk). 
Before joining NOC, I completed a PhD at the University of Leeds, where I trained and applied deep learning models to numerical weather prediction model data, to better understand the generation of gravity waves over Britain and Ireland.
Most of my work work (as opposed to fun work) can be found on the relevant GitHub organisation rather than here. Try [NOC Ocean Informatics](https://github.com/NOC-OI) or [NOC AI Research](https://github.com/NOC-AI-Research).
