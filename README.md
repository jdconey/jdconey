## Hello 

I'm a research software engineer at the UK's National Oceanography Centre (NOC: https://www.noc.ac.uk). 
Before joining NOC, I completed a PhD at the University of Leeds, where I trained and applied deep learning models to numerical weather prediction model data, to better understand the generation of gravity waves over Britain and Ireland.
